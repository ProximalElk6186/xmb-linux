# About the UI:
Scaling support for the UI will be added later.





Plus, if somebody has the PS3, please record a video of you showcasing the PS3's XrossMediaBar features, etc.: it will help the project a lot.


# About the xml.xml file:
This file is ripped from the PS3's XMB's file.

**IT MUST NOT BE CHANGED!**
