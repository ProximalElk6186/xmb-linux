## The XMBâ„¢'s sounds.
Some info about them:

snd_cathegory_decide,

snd_cursor,

snd_decide,

snd_option

all seem to be byte-identical.

Although snd_cancel SOUNDS similar, it's NOT byte-identical with snd_cathegory_decide,
 snd_cursor,
 snd_decide,
 snd_option.

It is actually a bit quieter and lower-pitched.
